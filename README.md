# Customers-Churn-Prediction
## Overview
Churn is a widespread problem across almost every industry. However, it is especially relevant to the telecommunications market, as many believe it to have reached saturation point. Competition is at an all-time high and many telcos are recognizing the need to improve customer experience and service in order to lower customer churn rates and compete effectively.  

## Daataset

- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support,     and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
